1. Open a Bank Account
Choose an Israeli bank and open a bank account. It is recommended to choose a bank that is near your home or work. 

2. Ministry of Immigration & Absorption
Once you’ve opened and activated your bank account, set an appointment with the Ministry of Immigration & Absorption (Misrad HaKlita) in your city. You will then start to receive your Sal Klita (basket of benefits). 

3. Health Insurance
Before you made Aliyah, you probably chose a Kupat Cholim (HMO). Go to a branch and get registered.

4. Ulpan
One of your benefits is a Hebrew Language course (Ulpan). You will receive more information during your first visit at Misrad HaKlita.

5. School
If you have children, set an appointment with the school manager in order to arrange schooling for them.

Moving to a new country can be both exciting and daunting, especially when it involves navigating a new language, culture, and way of life. For olim hadashim, or new immigrants to Israel, this experience can be particularly challenging. Fortunately, there are a number of governmental and non-profit organizations throughout Israel that are dedicated to helping olim acclimate to their new surroundings and build a sense of community. From providing language classes to connecting newcomers with local mentors, these organizations play an essential role in supporting Israel’s new immigrants and helping them thrive in their new homes.

Organizations that aid in the acclimation of olim hadashim to Israel can be found on this list.
